            <p>
              Openness, accountability, and honesty define government
              transparency. In a free society, transparency is government's
              obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
              of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at
              Data Insight Group we believe that government should be
              transparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how
              officials conduct the public business and spend taxpayer money
              must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency
              allows good and just governance. Transparency promotes
              accountability and provides information for citizens about what
              their Government is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also believe that government should be participatory. Public
              engagement enhances the Government's effectiveness and improves
              the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
              society, and public officials benefit from having access to that
              dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use our site to become
              actively engaged in American government.
            </p>

              Data Insight Group works to disclose information in forms that the
              public can readily find and use. We solicit public feedback to
              identify information of greatest use to the public.

              <h3>Background History of Government Transparency</h3>
              <p>
                In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
                scrutiny and susceptible to public opinion dates back at least
                to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of
                their intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative
                instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with
                Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as
                part of its constitution (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This
                approach, and that of the philosophes more broadly, is strongly
                related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century
                public sphere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America
                (1776) and France (1789), freedom of the press enshrined
                provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
                freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the
                nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row
                back on these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of
                eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill and Acton
                prominent among the latter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of
                contemporary democratic practice and is often linked to the
                passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
                countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information
                legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions to the
                eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of
                openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on
                Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                legislation in 1999).
              </p>
              <p>
                The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
                in 1966, FOIAs, Access to Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent
                laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
